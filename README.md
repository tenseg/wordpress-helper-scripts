# WordPress Helper Scripts

This project contains various scripts that simplify WP site management. They are intended to run on a local Mac, and use the WP-CLI aliasing to run commands in succession on remote WP installations. As such, all scripts expect the first argument to be am alias name. WP-CLI is expected to be in your PATH, as these are not intended to be run automatically.
